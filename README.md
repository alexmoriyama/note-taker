# Note Taker

## Task Description

  In this note taker task, I was asked to complete the back-end components of the note taking site. In order to complete this task, I added the following components:
  * A save feature for the notes to save your note on the taskbar.
  * When the note gets saved, it stacks on the left hand side with other existing notes.
  * When you reopen a saved note, it moves to the right hand side of the interface.
  * When you click on the note, you have the ability to delete a note.

## Deployment

You can find the note taking application [here](https://note-taker-moriyama.herokuapp.com/).

## Special mentions

Thanks to my TA and my tutor for helping me complete the back end of this application.
